**LOTO: Layout Of Trail Orienteering**

Creates maps required for use in TrailO competitions. Currently, it depends on Purple Pen, although I hope to offer a choice of dependenices or even none in the future. This project started as TCTemplate, but was renamed LOTO in 2021 to reflect its broader scope.
