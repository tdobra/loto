    <h2>Requirements</h2>
  </header>
  <main>
    <ul>
      <li>LOTO works on any device with most modern web browsers, including most phones and desktop computers, including Windows, MacOS, Linux and Android. On Microsoft Edge, version 79+ is required.</li>
      <li>To prepare the maps in Purple Pen, Microsoft Windows XP SP2 or newer is required. For other operating systems, use a virtual Windows 10 installation for free - see the <a href="http://purplepen.golde.org/virtualbox.htm" target="prequisites" rel="external">Purple Pen website</a> for details.</li>
      <li>You will need a printer capable of a 10 mm margin on all 4 sides for A4 paper.</li>
    </ul>
    <h3>Data Usage</h3>
    <p>The initial webpage is 86 kB, generating PDFs for printing will use 9.1 MB in total, and generating PNGs for online TempO will use 9.4 MB in total. However, all of these files are cached, so are not downloaded again unless you close the webpage. Your map files are not uploaded to the server, so the quality of your maps does not affect data usage.</p>
